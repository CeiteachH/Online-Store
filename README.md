# Online-Store
Working with CRUD and Online Database
(full stack)
Developed	two	applications	for	maintaining	a	database	of	personal	details	for	users	
of	 a	 hypothetical	 online	 store.	 The	 database,	called	 USERS,	
contains	 tables	 that	 record	 user	 personal	 information	 [Title,	 First	Name(s)*,	 Surname*,	Mobile*,	 Email	 Address*],	 and	 both	 home	 and	 shipping	 addresses	 [Address	 Line	 1*,	 Address	 Line	 2,	
Town*,	County/City*,	Eircode].	The	fields	marked	*	are	required	fields,	i.e.,	they	must	contain	values.
Solutions	provide	CRUD	functionality	for	Creating,	Searching	(Retrieving),	Updating,	and	
Deleting	 user	information	 stored	in	a	 relational	 database	 (MariaDB	 database)	using	a	
“back	end”	application	and	using	a	modified	“back	end”	together	with	an	AJAX-driven	“front	end”	application	demonstrating	a	full-stack	solution.
Developed	a	fully	functional User	Interface	(UI) that	supports	the	 full	CRUD	activity.	
(used Html,Javascript / nodejs, mongodb, JQuery, boostrap(bootsnipp))
